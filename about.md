<details><summary><strong>How It Works In SoFy</strong></summary>

### Access URLs

Build a solution with OneDB and the HCL OneDB High Availability (HA) & Scale-Out Demo Pack, and deploy it into the sandbox. Once your SoFy solution is deployed, you can find all access URLs for this service from the SoFy Solution Console.

1. OneDB Scale-Out demo home page will be at:

   `https://onedb-scale-app.{sandbox-id}.play.{sofy-domain}`

   For example, `https://onedb-scale-app.sbx0034.play.sofy.dev/`

2. OneDB Demo Pack home page will be at:

   `https://onedbdemo.{sandbox-id}.play.{sofy-domain}`

   For example, `https://onedbdemo.sbx0034.play.sofy.dev/`

3. SoFy Solution Console will be at:

   `https://sofy-console.{sandbox-id}.play.{sofy-domain}`

   For example, `https://sofy-console.sbx0034.play.sofy.dev/`

<details><summary><strong>Troubleshooting & Limitations</strong></summary>

### Limitations

- This demo pack will only function properly in SoFy sandbox environments because it does not work with self-signed certs.
